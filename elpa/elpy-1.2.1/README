Quick Installation
==================

You can also read the `detailed installation instructions`__.

.. __: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/wiki/Installation

First, install the required Python packages:::

  pip install elpy rope

(Note: If you are installing the development version of elpy, do not
install the elpy Python package, but simply put the repository in your
``PYTHONPATH``.)

Evaluate this in your ``*scratch*`` buffer:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))


Then run ``M-x package-refresh-contents`` to load the contents of the
new repository, and ``M-x package-install RET elpy RET`` to install
elpy.

Finally, add the following to your ``.emacs``:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (package-initialize)
  (elpy-enable)

Done.
