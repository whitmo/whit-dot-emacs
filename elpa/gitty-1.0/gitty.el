;;; Commentary:

;; gitty is a very small extension to `vc-mode' to make common git
;; commands easier to access than in the normal environment. The idea
;; is that you do most interaction with git using the command line or
;; magit, but some often-used commands are accessible easily.

;; C-x v b is the main new command. It prompts for an existing branch
;; with tab completion enabled and checks that out. If the entered
;; branch does not exist, it prompts if it should be created. This
;; makes switching between branches for quick feature branches much
;; easier than with `vc-mode'.

;; gitty also provides quick keys to stash save and stash pop in
;; the current repository, and to see the current `status'.

;; For more information, see the docstring for the command `gitty-mode`.

;; Note, though, that gitty does override some `vc-mode' keybindings
;; that are less useful for git.
