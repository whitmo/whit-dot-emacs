(autoload 'jsshell "jsshell" "\
Run an inferior Javascript shell, with I/O through tne named
BUFFER (which defaults to `*JSShell*').

Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for BUFFER.

If BUFFER exists but the shell process is not running, it makes a new shell.

If BUFFER exists and the shell process is running, just switch to BUFFER.

See the help for `shell' for more details.  (Type
\\[describe-mode] in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)

The shell is CSCRIPT.exe (see `jsshell-location-of-cscript-exe'),
which runs a Javascript program that implements a
Read-Execute-Print Loop (REPL). This function looks for the
source for the REPL program first as a string stored in
`jsshell-js-src'. This variable will be non-nil when running the
shell from the bundle version of jsshell.  If that variable nil,
this function gets the source for the REPL from
`jsshell-location-of-jsshell-js'.

NB: Literal strings typed into the shell buffer need extra escaping.
This is espcially a problem with regex strings. eg, a  in a JS
regex gets transformed into just a d when run through the
jsshell.  I think this is not a problem when loading files with
`jsshell-load-file'. The problem may not be worth fixing.
